# XV11 LIDAR test

## Preamble

This repository is phased out from ev3dev-mapping. Some information here may be not up-to-date for a while.
Precisely: http://www.ev3dev.org/docs/tutorials/using-xv11-lidar/ was updated to always load dc-motor driver manually.
This change is not reflected here yet.
If you want to use this code with 2-wire soldered motor change the output port mode to dc-motor and use dc-motor instead of tacho-motor.

## Overview

This is code for XV11 LIDAR test. The test outputs semicolon separated distance data for angles 0-359.
The output can be redirected to file, transferred to PC and plotted.

Alternatively, xv11test can be called with -raw argument to output synchronized binary data.
You can pipe the data to your application written in any language (effectively getting LIDAR data on you standard input).
See `examples` directory for C, C# and Java code.

If you just want simple C/C++ library to communicate with the LIDAR see [xv11lidar](https://github.com/bmegli/xv11lidar) repository.

## LIDAR test

### Instructions Assumptions 
- hardware is connected as in http://www.ev3dev.org/docs/tutorials/using-xv11-lidar/
- lidar data connector is connected to port 1
- lidar motor interface is avaliable at `/sys/class/tacho-motor/motor0`

### Building the xv11test

Instructions are for compiling the code directly on EV3 (get the files to EV3 and use ssh)

- Get the build system (or just get the gcc and make package instead)
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential
```
- Compile the code - enter directory and type `make`

### Running the test

- Put the port in `other-uart` mode
```bash
 echo other-uart > /sys/class/lego-port/port0/mode
```
- Spin the motor around 200-300 RPM CCW
```bash
echo 40 > /sys/class/tacho-motor/motor0/duty_cycle_sp
echo run-direct > /sys/class/tacho-motor/motor0/command
```
- Run xv11test
```bash
./xv11test /dev/tty_in1
```
- Run xv11test and redirect output to file
```bash
./xv11test /dev/tty_in1 > distances.csv
```
- Stop the motor
```bash 
echo stop > /sys/class/tacho-motor/motor0/command
```

### Results plot

The file `xv11plot.ods` is Open Document Spreadsheet with the formulas for converting xv11test angle/distance output to 2D points graph.
You can open `xv11plot.ods` in OpenOffice Calc, Microsoft Excel or any other software supporting Open Document Spreadsheets.

To make a plot:
- Get the xv11test output `distances.csv` file to your PC
- Open `xv11plot.ods` in software of your choice (e.g. OpenOffice Calc, Microsoft Excel, ...) 
- Copy your result from `distances.csv` to lines in `xv11plot.ods` where it says so

See your own plot and note how to convert LIDAR angle/distance output and apply geometric correction in the spreadsheet

### Working with binary data

If you are working in C/C++ you can use [xv11lidar](https://github.com/bmegli/xv11lidar) library with functions `InitLaser`, `ReadLaser` and `CloseLaser`.

If you don't feel comfortable with C/C++ code or don't want to write UART communication code, you can run xv11test with -raw argument and pipe its output to your application in any language.

See also `examples` subdirectory for C, C# and Java examples.

The xv11test syntax to get synchronized binary output is following:
```bash
xv11test terminal_device -raw [frames_per_read] [frames_limit]
```

Where:
- `terminal_device` is path to tty device (e.g. `/dev/tty_in1`)
- `frames_per_read` is optional number of LIDAR frames per single read/write, 15 by default (60 degrees)
- `frames_limit` is optional limit for number of frames, 90 by default (360 degrees), use 0 to get continuous binary data

By piping xv11test with -raw argument to your application you can read binary LIDAR data from your standard input. 

Assumptions for those use cases are the same as before (port in `other-uart` mode, motor spinning, etc.)

#### Example 1 - 360 degree scan piped to other_program

```bash
./xv11test /dev/tty_in1 -raw | ./other_program
```

Or the same explicitly - read/write in chunks of 15 frames, limit to 90 frames (each 4 degrees):

```bash
./xv11test /dev/tty_in1 -raw 15 90 | ./other_program
```

#### Example 2 - 360 degree scan redirected to binary file

 ```bash
./xv11test /dev/tty_in1 -raw > scan360.bin
```

#### Example 3 - 360 degree scan redirected to binary file and used in other_program

```bash
./xv11test /dev/tty_in1 -raw > scan360.bin
./other_program < scan360.bin
```

#### Example 4 - continuous binary data piped to other_program

```bash
./xv11test /dev/tty_in1 -raw 15 0 | ./other_program
```
